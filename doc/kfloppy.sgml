<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KFloppy Formater
<p>
KFloppy Formater is part  of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KFloppy Formater can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KFloppy Formater, you need the latest versions 
of the KDE libraries. All required libraries as well as KFloppy Formater itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KFloppy Formater on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KEdit distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KFloppy Formater uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect>Usage<p>

KFloppy Formater is very simply to use. In fact most of its functions should be
selfexplanatory. I really have absolutely no time to write a long
manual at this point. Please contact me if you would like to write it.
