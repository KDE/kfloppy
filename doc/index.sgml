<sect>Introduction

<p>
KFloppy Formatter is a program that lets you format 3.5" and 5.25" floppy disks. 
<p>
I hope you will enjoy this little tool. Please report any problems or feature requests to the KDE
mailing lists.

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KFloppy Formatter
<p>
KFloppy Formatter is part of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KFloppy Formatter can be found in the kdeutils package on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, 
the main ftp site of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KFloppy Formatter, you need the latest versions 
of the KDE libraries. All required libraries as well as KFloppy Formatter itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KFloppy Formatter on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KFloppy distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

Since KFloppy Formatter uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the KDE mailing lists.

<sect>Formatting Disks with KFloppy<p>
<p>
To use KFloppy you must have either a 5.25" or 3.5" disk drive connected to your
system.  Insert the disk you want to format. <bf>Do not mount it</bf>. Then, select the appropriate
options as described below.

<sect1>Floppy Drive
<p>
Select the drive that contains the disk you wish to format. For those of you not familiar with 
PC drive labelling conventions, letter <tt>A:</tt> corresponds to the <tt>fd0</tt> device and
<tt>B:</tt> is 
the <tt>fd1</tt> device. Almost all new computers will only have one 3.5" floppy as their <tt>A:</tt>
(<tt>fd0</tt>) drive.
<p>
<sect1>Density
<p>
Select the density of the disk you wish to format. Most of the 3.5" and 5.25" disks produced in 
the last 5 years are high density (HD) disks. Older disks may only support the double density (DD)
format.  High density disks can be formatted as double density, but you will not be able to use the
full 1.44 Mbytes or 1.2 Mbytes of space on the disk. The 800k disk format used by Macintosh floppy 
drives is not currently supported, and cannot be supported at all on PC floppy drives since they are
not capable of formatting disks in that fashion. 
<p>
Here is a list of the properties for each disk type and density combination:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>3.5" DD: double-sided, 80 tracks, 9 sectors/track  - 720K 
<item>3.5" HD: double-sided, 80 tracks, 18 sectors/track - 1440K 
<item>5.25" DD: double-sided, 40 tracks, 9 sectors/track  - 360K      
<item>5.25" HD: double-sided, 80 tracks, 15 sectors/track - 1200K 
</itemize>

<sect1>File Systems
<p>
KFloppy supports two file system types for formatting floppy disks: MS-DOS and ext2, the Linux
file system. If you want to use the floppy across many different operating systems, the
MS-DOS file system is a good choice, but if you only need to use the disk on Linux systems, use
ext2.

<sect1>Formatting Options
<p>
There are two different ways that KFloppy can format a disk.
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>Quick Erase</tag>
This simply puts the new file system on the disk. All data on the disk is erased. If the density of
the disk is different than the selected density for formatting then the tracks and sectors on the
disk will be reallocated before the file system is made.
<p>
<tag>Full Format</tag>
A full format reallocates the tracks and sectors, puts the selected file system on the disk, and
then verifies the format, blocking out any bad sectors it finds.
</descrip>
<p>
MS-DOS disks can have a volume label, which can be created by checking the <bf>Create Label</bf> box
and typing in the desired volume label.  Ext2 formatted floppies cannot have labels.
