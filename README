KFloppy 2.1
===========

KFloppy was "done and feature complete and bug free", for systems
running Linux. Other KDE platforms had an app that put up a warning
box and was then totally inert. I've restructured the whole thing,
cleaned up the code somewhat, and modularized it. 

Currently KFloppy is tested on a FBSD machine with a floppy drive
and a zip drive. It should still behave on Linux, but I haven't tried.

KFloppy 0.2
===========

	KFloppy formats disks and puts a DOS or ext2fs filesystem on
them.
