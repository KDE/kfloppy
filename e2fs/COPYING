This package, the EXT2 filesystem utilities, are protected by the GNU
Public License, with the following exception --- 

	If the version string in the file version.h contains the words
	"WORK IN PROGRESS", then this package must be distributed in
	source form only.  You can give a copy of the binary for
	e2fsck to help a friend recover his or her filesystem, as the
	need arises.  However, "WORK IN PROGRESS" means exactly that.
	The package is in ALPHA testing, and for your protection as
	much as mine, I'd rather not have it appear in a some
	distribution --- especially not a CD-ROM distribution!

The most recent officially distributed version can be found on
tsx-11.mit.edu, in /pub/linux/packages/ext2fs.  If you need to make a
distribution, that's the one you should use.  If there is some reason
why you'd like a more recent version that is still in ALPHA testing
for your distribution, please contact me (tytso@mit.edu), and we can
see if we can't come to an arrangement.  The release schedules for
this package are flexible, if you give me enough lead time.
